ques)))Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

code:
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        temp = x
        rev = 0

        while temp>0:
            r = temp%10
            temp//=10
            rev = rev*10 + r
            
        return rev==x
